"""Exercise 4.0 — Working with a list

WHAT THE PROGRAM MUST DO
    Build a list of at least eight items, then display: the whole list, one item of your
    choice, the list sorted, and something computed from it.

ANSWER THESE FIRST, in comments at the top of your file
    1. What goes in?
    2. What happens to it?
    3. What comes out?
    4. What is your list about, and what did you compute from it? Why is that number
       interesting?

WHAT THE AI CANNOT KNOW
    The content of your list. It must come from your own field: marketing channels,
    campaign names, product references, cities you operate in, monthly budgets. Not
    fruit, not "item1, item2, item3".

    Keep this file. Exercise 5.1 and exercise 6.0 both reuse the list you build here.

CHECK IT YOURSELF
    If you computed an average, a total or a maximum, work it out by hand on three of
    your items first, then check your program agrees on those three.

# Your code below
# 1. In: nothing typed by the user, the list is written directly in the code
# 2. Process: the program builds a list of 8 monthly ad budgets, sorts it, and computes the total and the average
# 3. Out: the whole list, the first item, the sorted list, the total and the average
# 4. What my list is about, and what I computed from it:
#    The list holds the advertising budget (in euros) of a marketing team for 8 months.
#    I computed the total (how much was spent in all) and the average
#    (useful to plan the budget of the next months).

# Your code below
# the list of 8 monthly budgets
budgets = [1200, 800, 1500, 950, 2000, 700, 1800, 1100]

print("Whole list:", budgets)
print("Budget of the first month:", budgets[0])
print("Sorted list:", sorted(budgets))

# total and average
total = sum(budgets)
average = total / len(budgets)
print("Total budget:", total)
print("Average monthly budget:", average)

# check by hand: sum of the first three items
print("Sum of the first three items:", sum(budgets[:3]))
